# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

public/: Contains static files like the main index.html file, favicon, and manifest.json.
src/assets/: Houses global static files such as images and global stylesheets (e.g., SASS/SCSS files, CSS).
src/components/: Contains reusable React components. Splitting them into common (for truly generic components like buttons and inputs) and layout (for layout components like headers, footers, and navigation bars) can help manage components more effectively.
src/features/: For larger applications, organizing code by feature (or domain) rather than by file type is beneficial. Each feature directory contains all related components, hooks, services, and state management specific to that feature.
src/hooks/: Custom React hooks that can be shared across components.
src/i18n/: Internationalization setup files, for supporting multiple languages.
src/app/: Contains foundational app configurations like the Redux store setup (store.js) and the root reducer (rootReducer.js).
src/routes/: Defines the routing setup for the application. Includes specialized route components like PrivateRoute.js for authenticated routes.
src/services/: Service files or APIs interactions, including any setup for HTTP clients (e.g., Axios instances) and service files for different features.
src/utils/: Utility functions and helpers that can be used across the application.
src/App.js: The main React application component that includes route definitions and global layout components.
src/index.js: The entry point of the React application, where ReactDOM renders the App component into the DOM.
